Scripts which are going to save you tons are dollars are on these topics.

Automated VM Shutdown during Off-Peak Hours: Implement a script that schedules your virtual machines to shut down automatically during non-business hours. This ensures you’re not billed for idle VMs when they’re not in use.

Snapshot Cleanup Script: Create a script that identifies and removes unnecessary VM snapshots. Regularly cleaning up snapshots helps reduce storage costs and keeps your environment tidy.

Unattached Disk Removal: Develop a script that detects and deletes unattached disks. These orphaned disks can accumulate over time and contribute to unnecessary expenses.

App Gateway Management Script: Write a script to identify inactive or unused application gateways and remove them. This helps optimize costs by eliminating resources that aren’t actively serving traffic.

Reservations: By committing to one-year or three-year plans for multiple Azure products, you can optimize costs by prepaying for usage. Reserving resources like virtual machines (VMs) or databases ensures predictable pricing and potential savings compared to pay-as-you-go rates.

Savings Plans: Similar to reservations, Savings Plans offer flexibility across different services. They allow you to save on compute usage (such as VMs) without being tied to specific instance types. Savings Plans automatically apply discounts based on your usage patterns.
